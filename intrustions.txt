Backend Python Second Semester Examination Project


You are building an API for a medical appointment application. 

The application has the following entities:
Patient: id, name, age, sex, weight, height, phone
Doctors: id, name, specialization, phone, is_available (defaults to True)
Appointment: id, patient, doctor, date

Description
The application is to facilitate appointment bookings between Patients and Doctors. A doctor can only have one appointment scheduled with a patient at a time, so if a patient needs to book an appointment and no doctor is available, your API should respond with the proper response and status code

The API should provide the following endpoints:
   1. CRUD endpoints for Patients
   2. CRUD endpoints for Doctors
   3. Create an appointment. Only patients can create an appointment. When a patient tries to create an appointment, the first available doctor is assigned to the Appointment. If no doctors available, return the appropriate response and status code to the user.
   4. Complete an appointment. Doing this will make the Doctor available again and other patients can book the doctor.
   5. Cancel an appointment before it is completed, making the doctor free again.
   6. Set availability status. This is for the Doctors, allowing them to set their status to unavailable to prevent them from being booked.

NOTE:
- For your database, use an in-memory data structure such as list or dictionaries.
- Use Pydantic for data validation.
- Use the appropriate status codes where necessary.
- Use proper code structuring.
- You are required to put your submission in a public github repository and make your submission
